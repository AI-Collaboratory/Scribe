# Scribe by DCIC, Univesity of Maryland iSchool

[Scribe](http://scribeproject.github.io/) is a framework for crowdsourcing the transcription of text-based documents, particularly documents that are not well suited for Optical Character Recognition. It is originally developed by a collaboration between [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/) and [The New York Public Library Labs](http://labs.nypl.org/) with generous support from [The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), Office of Digital Humanities](http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh).

This repository is for (1) a Scribe platform modified and adjusted for Redlining documents from 1920's and 30's; and (2) code snippets that support generating configuration files and installing the development environment.

If you have any questions on the Redlining project, contact us at:

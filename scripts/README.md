# Python Scripts for Processing Data


## `csv_generator`
This script is essential in generating configuration files for setting up a city on Scribe. 
For the information on how to use them and where you put the configuration files, see [SetUp City](../doc/setup_city.md)

## `data_cleaning`
This is a Jupyter Notebook file that process the MongoDB output. Once you export the JSON file out of Scribe's MongoDB, you can use this script to convert the JSON file to the CSV format (so to make it ready for further analysis).
Use `Azeez_json_cleaning.ipynb` for the processing.
In order to run this script, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your PC, which can be installed by installing Anaconda.

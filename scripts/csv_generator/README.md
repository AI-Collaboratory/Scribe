---------

#### scribe_csv_generator.py
	This file is for generating configuration csv files from a folder that contains scanned documents and thumbnails. "BlueText" folder contains image files, and output files will be saved under the "csv" folder (if not exists, create one.).

#### html_generator.py
	This is not for the Scribe platform, but for generating plain HTML pages that display all the documents.
